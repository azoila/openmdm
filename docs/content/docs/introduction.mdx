# Introduction

OpenMDM is a modern, open-source Mobile Device Management (MDM) SDK designed for developers who need enterprise-grade device management capabilities without the complexity of traditional MDM solutions.

## What is OpenMDM?

OpenMDM provides a complete toolkit for managing Android devices at scale. It's designed to be:

- **Embeddable**: Integrate MDM capabilities directly into your existing applications
- **Developer-friendly**: Clean TypeScript APIs with comprehensive documentation
- **Flexible**: Use only the features you need with a modular plugin architecture
- **Open Source**: MIT licensed and community-driven

## Key Features

### Device Enrollment

Easily enroll devices using QR codes, NFC, or zero-touch enrollment. OpenMDM supports multiple enrollment methods to fit your deployment scenario.

### Policy Management

Define and enforce device policies including:

- App allowlists and blocklists
- Network and WiFi configuration
- Security requirements (passwords, encryption)
- System settings restrictions

### Remote Commands

Execute commands on enrolled devices:

- Lock and unlock devices
- Wipe device data
- Install and uninstall applications
- Reboot devices

### Kiosk Mode

Lock devices to specific applications for dedicated-use scenarios like:

- Retail point-of-sale
- Digital signage
- Field service applications
- Educational devices

## Architecture

OpenMDM follows a modular architecture with three main components:

1. **Core SDK** (`@openmdm/core`): The main server-side SDK that handles device management logic
2. **Storage Adapters**: Pluggable storage backends (SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.)
3. **Push Providers**: Integration with push notification services (FCM, HMS)

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install @openmdm/core @openmdm/storage-sqlite @openmdm/push-fcm
```

```typescript
import { createMDMServer } from '@openmdm/core';
import { sqliteStorage } from '@openmdm/storage-sqlite';
import { fcmPush } from '@openmdm/push-fcm';

const mdm = createMDMServer({
  storage: sqliteStorage({ filename: './mdm.db' }),
  push: fcmPush({ projectId: 'your-project-id' }),
});

// Start managing devices
const devices = await mdm.devices.list();
```
